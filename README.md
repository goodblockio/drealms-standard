# dRealms Token Standard

The dRealms Token Standard is a lightweight cross-game NFT standard for EOSIO software.

## `Features`

* `Robust Token Ownership and Authorship`

    dRealms offers the ideal ownership/authorship model for token economics. The current tokenomics paradigm pushes for 'complete ownership', whether that design works for every use case or not. dRealms offers a suite of tokenomics designs and developers can choose which one best suits their unique business model.

* `Lightweight and Scalable Design`

    Because of dRealms's elegant design, it uses far fewer resources to operate. Contract tables are lean and have been optimized to scale naturally by demand.

* `Custom Licensing Models`

    **Disabled Licensing**: this setting disables new license additions entirely. This feature is desirable for token creators who want to maintain full control of all NFT assets.

    **Open Licensing**: this setting allows any user to reserve a license slot for an NFT for free (not counting RAM costs). This setting is desirable if asset creators want their NFTs to be heavily modifiable and open for all asset creators to use.

    **Permissioned Licensing**: this setting allows token creators to individually approve additional license slots from a list of requests submitted by prospective asset developers.
